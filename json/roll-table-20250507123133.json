Each participant is required to bring an ooze to the event. 3 premade stone towers are erected at the outskirts of the fair. The participants climb some scaffolding to place their ooze at the top. The first ooze to eat their way to the bottom of the tower wins. Over the past few years, this selfmade competition has attracted the attention of the townsfolk who enjoy betting on the competition.",
